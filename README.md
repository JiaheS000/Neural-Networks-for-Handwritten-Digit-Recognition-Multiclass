# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Multiclass
This document is an exercise of the Neural networks topic.

At the beginning of this exercise, plenty of time is spent on building up the necessary environment, to process all pre-setting code and import prameter successfully. After a lot of time and huge effort input, a certain amount of problems are solved, and several outcomes are generated step by step, line by line. These partial results show great completment of this exercise and fitting the expected outcome. However, there are still some amount of steps and results that did not meet the satisfying goal. Due to the missing file, impropriate coding segment, and uneditable module existing, a few parts inside of this exercise cannot run successfully showing an error message. Moreover, some of the running results do not meet the requirement or do not meet the expectations after several rounds of tests. Thus, further work and research are needed to improve these errors to lead this exercise more perfectly.
